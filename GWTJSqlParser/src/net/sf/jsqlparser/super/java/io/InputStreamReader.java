/**
 * An InputStreamReader is a bridge from byte streams to character streams: It
 * reads bytes and decodes them into characters using a specified {@link
 * java.nio.charset.Charset charset}.  The charset that it uses
 * may be specified by name or may be given explicitly, or the platform's
 * default charset may be accepted.
 *
 * <p> Each invocation of one of an InputStreamReader's read() methods may
 * cause one or more bytes to be read from the underlying byte-input stream.
 * To enable the efficient conversion of bytes to characters, more bytes may
 * be read ahead from the underlying stream than are necessary to satisfy the
 * current read operation.
 *
 * <p> For top efficiency, consider wrapping an InputStreamReader within a
 * BufferedReader.  For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * BufferedReader in
 *   = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see BufferedReader
 * @see InputStream
 * @see java.nio.charset.Charset
